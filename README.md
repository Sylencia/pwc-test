This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

The app has three tasks preloaded in the state to give a quick look at how each state looks.

## To test:

```
yarn install
yarn test
```

Tests were only conducted on a utility function basis.
